Project Description:
This project is a comprehensive analysis of OLA ride data using Power BI, aimed at deriving actionable insights from ride bookings, customer and driver behavior, vehicle usage, cancellations, and revenue
trends. The dataset contains records of rides, including booking information, distances, payment methods, ratings, and more. By transforming this raw data into interactive visuals and reports, this project
helps understand key performance metrics and user behavior patterns critical for business decisions.To provide a user-friendly experience, the analysis is divided into five well-structured dashboards, each
focused on a specific area of interest. These dashboards are interconnected through navigation buttons, making it easy to switch between different views and extract insights seamlessly.

Project Details:
The dataset includes fields such as Booking_ID, Date, Vehicle_Type, Booking_Status, Ride_Distance, Payment_Method, Driver_Ratings, Customer_Rating, and more. These were cleaned, modeled, and visualized
using Power BI’s advanced features like DAX, slicers, and buttons. Each dashboard focuses on one domain—ratings, cancellations, revenue, vehicle trends, and overall performance—allowing a targeted and
interactive exploration of key metrics.

Problems Solved Through This Project
1. Ride Volume Over Time: Analyzed ride activity trends to understand peak booking periods, which can help optimize fleet distribution and marketing efforts.

2. Booking Status Breakdown: Categorized completed, cancelled, and incomplete rides to identify service delivery gaps and improve customer experience.

3. Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance: Identified which vehicle types cover the most distance, helping OLA optimize fleet allocation and maintenance scheduling.

4. Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type: Helped measure customer satisfaction with different vehicle categories, guiding service quality improvements.

5. Cancelled Rides Reasons: Provided a clear view of the main reasons for cancellations (customer or driver-related), which is crucial for improving policies and reducing ride abandonment rates.

6. Revenue by Payment Method: Analyzed the contribution of different payment methods to total revenue, enabling better financial planning and promotions.

7. Top 5 Customers by Booking Value: Recognized the most valuable customers for loyalty programs and personalized marketing strategies.

8. Ride Distance Distribution Per Day: Offered insights into daily operational loads, which can assist in managing driver shifts and fuel costs.

9. Driver Ratings Distribution: Monitored overall driver performance and quality of service based on customer feedback.

10. Customer vs Driver Ratings: Compared the perception gap between riders and drivers, fostering a better understanding of mutual satisfaction and areas of friction.
